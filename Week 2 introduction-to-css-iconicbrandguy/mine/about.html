                    <p>The intonations are marked in the respelling by a system of dots and accents placed at relative heights
                        over the vowels. The patterns recorded in this way are not necessarily the only possibilities in spoken Spanish,
                        but they are all normal patterns which have been thoroughly and widely tested.
                    </p>
                    <p>Illustrations of grammar points, new words are introduced in order to fill out patterns needed to do the
                        exercises. New words are always clearly indicated by placing them on a line themselves, indented between the
                        lines that are complete sentences. Since each new word is introduced in this fashion only once, the student
                        should take pains to be sure he learns each word as it is presented. Careful pains have been taken to see that
                        each word introduced will reappear many times later in the course, to help the student assimilate each word in
                        a variety of contexts.
                    </p>
                    <p>The student should very carefully learn both the literal meanings of each individual word or phrase that is
                        given on an indented line and the meaning that appears in the full sentences. It should not be cause for concern if the meaning in context is strikingly different from the literal meaning. In the construction of each
                        dialog, the Spanish was written first, and the corresponding English is its closest equivalent and not a literal
                        translation. It is therefore not at all surprising if the Spanish does not seem to 'follow' the English.
